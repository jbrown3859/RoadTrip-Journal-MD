## Day 1
#### Tripometer: 738
- We left La Crescenta around 6:20 and arrived at our stop for the night at around 6:30, making around 12 hours of driving for the day. 
- We ate lunch at Cesar Chavez Park in Berkeley at a turnaround where one could see 3 major Bay Area bridges.
- The scene change was drastic as we went from the 5 to the 580 - from desert and nothingness to dense forest, and even denser forest and interesting landscapes as we went north on the 101.
- Tonight we are staying on a dirt roundabout hidden next to a logging road, about 15 minutes north of Trinidad. Found on **iOverlander**, we chose this after exploring two other options, one just being a small turnout on a one lane overgrown dirt road in the hills above the coast.
- We arent tired even after all the driving today. However, Andrew is having to deal with Lactaid responsibilities.
- No service here but I am collecting most media on an external drive.
- We stopped for gas in Fresno, Berkeley, and near Humbolt.

## Day 2
#### Tripometer: 1002
- Woke up this morning at 7:30, made coffee and bagels, and got on the road north, following the 101 all the way.
- We followed a scenic route on Yurok territory and found an amazing overlook on the last of the California Coast.
- Around 11:40, we stopped at Whaleshead beach. It was completely fogged in to about 50 foot visiblity and led to some interesting photos. We made lunch there and headed up north, stopping in Coos Bay. 
- We looked for Coos Bay stickers but couln't find any, so we bought local fudge. 
- In Coos Bay, we talked to the visitor information desk and learned that Oneata Gorge, our plan for tomorrow, was closed, and also learned how bad the 5 north into Portland would be. We decided to change day 3 to instead go to Eugene and back to the coast towards Cannon Beach. Plan to camp near Astoria.

- We settled tonight north of Florence in a camp called Horse Creek. It is in the clouds and everything, even the air, is wet. If you swipe your hand though the air it collects visible water. Cole and Andrew found orange berries, Salmon berries, and have obsessed over them. They are like bland raspberries.

- Roomate selection sucks. It opened today, I've made the obligatory facebook post. One guy's desciption was, "I have Porsche", and nothing else.
- Changing clothes for the first time tomorrow morning.

## Day 3
#### Tripometer: idk
- Tent was wet so we decided to let it dry a little in the morning sun. We looked at the traffic for the route to Eugene and decided against a roundtrip journey.
- We headed north on the 101 again and found some interesting things/observations
- a large cutout (maybe 15 ft tall) of a Japanese man holding a plate of sushi outside a closed Japanese restaurant
- A ton of drive thru coffee stands
- The suggested posted speeds for turns are high estimates, unlike california's lowball
- Cool tide pools along the coast

- We got to Cannon Beach and realized that the hype wasn't worth it. Drove to Ecola State Park and stopped at a cool overlook on Ecola Beach.

- We continued north, crossing the Astoria Bridge across the Columbia. Andrew yelled BRIDGE all the way across.
- We are now staying at Snag Lake in the mountains above Naselle, Washington. We got service here na dthe small lake is amazing. I am writing this while waiting to shoot the night sky.

- Another thing for today; we visited the Tillamook Creamery. It was like a lame amusement park.
- Tomorrow we will continue up to Cape Flattery and Neah Bay, meet Andrew's family, and stay near Port Angeles in an RV Park with them. The next day we have planned to go to the REI Flagship store in Seattle, ferry north, and explore Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest near the US Canada Border.
- Trying to wake up a little earlier tomorrow.

##### Days 4-6 are written in the past tense. I didnt do them until night 7
## Days 4-6
#### Tripometer: 2068.2 miles
- So after Florence, the PNW Itineray went out the window. After Snag Lake, we went up the Washington Coast and explored a little of Olympic National Park. Stopped at the Ranger Station and hiked less than a mile to a large tree.
- We also stopped at a fish hatchery on reservation land that was playing a 23 min video on the history of the reservation. We did not watch the whole video.
- Later, we arrived at Neah Bay and learned that we needed to buy a pass to park and hike to Cape Flattery. We did not do that. Instead, we just drove around and trued to find good photo ops. On the road out to Neah Bay one can see Canada.
- After that, we drove to Port Angeles. Cole and I argued about whether the name Guy can be pronounced "gee". I won.
- At the RV Park in Port Angeles, we met Andrew's family. We showered and did a load of laundry. We made smores and talked with Andrew's aunt, uncle, and cousin. At 11, we went out to the mouth of the sound and shot the sky.
- Dinner that night was interesting; Cole attempted chicken and white sauce. He cooked the chicken and started the white sauce. As he put the parmesean cheese in, it coagulated instead of melting in with the milk. We only at the chicken.
- I made coffee with 1/2 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp milk, rest water, and a dark french roast starbucks via. Bitter but very creamy.
- We woke up early the next day and headed for Kingston to board a ferry to Edmonds. We were trying to get into Seattle to Pike's Place. We drove in, parked, and started walking the couple blocks to Pike's Place. 
- However, we quickly learned that a Pride Parade was happenning on a street crossing our path. We eventually found a way through the parade and at lunch at the Pike's Place fish market. More specifically, Athenian Fish and Chips. The chef working infront of us had worked at Philmont in 2012. While at the market, we also bought a fresh salmon fillet for that night's dinner.
- We also walked the boardwalk and saw the 2 hour wait for the original Starbucks. We found our way back to the car eventually, fighting back through the parade. We drove to REI just to get stickers.
- Heading up the 5, we turned onto the 20 East. We planned to stay at a more primitive camp on Baker Lake. We found an amazing spot and were soon joined by a loud college group.
- We cooked the salmon somehow very well on the camp stove, as well as some mashed potatoes and fresh greenbeans.
- Here, we saw 2 snakes in camp.
- Day 6 we headed through the North Cascades, a look into what Glacier might be. We were a little dissapointed but really only got the roadside attractions. We drove all the way through Spokane, listening to a Dollop espisode on Spokane's history of corrupt police. We ate dinner at a Panda Express in Idaho and headed for the hills for camp.
- Midway to Spokane was the town of Winthrop, where we had lunch. Andrew drank all the pickle juice in the jar just to get the last 2 pickles and felt very sick afterwards.

## Day 7
#### Tripometer: 2356.5 miles
- After a week on the road, we are getting a little tired. We restocked in Hayden, Idaho. At the supermarket, we pretty much emptied our cooler because we had not been completely successful in keeping everything cold. We spent 2 hours there but are back on track now. We bought a lot more fruit and planned the meals a bit better.
- We drove to just outside Glacier National Park, crossing into Montana. The first site we found seemed good. It was off a dirt road out of a staging area on Flathead Lake. There was a roudy group of teenagers at the end of the road, 50 meters away.
- We made dinner and started to chill until we heard that they had an AR and were seeming to have too much fun with it. We quickly packed up the tent and searched iOverlander for a new site. We found maybe the best spot on the trip. It is a rocky beach on the side of a river and we are with other overlanding folk. Super cool.
- We have to start being aware of bears now.
- Also, everytime we cross a bridge now, we all yell BRIDGE all the way across.
- Plan tomorrow is to enter Glacier National Park, use THE pass, and begin exploring.

## Day 8
#### Tripometer: 2522.7 miles
- Today we drove the Going-to-the-Sun Road through Glacier. It was really foggy but we stopped often for pictures. About half way up we were stopped in a line of cars. They were plowing snow and had nearly the entire road wait. We got through, trying to stop at Logan Pass but couldnt find parking. 
- After we got through the road, we took the 2 back which was a lot longer and kinda went through the middle of nowhere montana.
- We went back to the riverside for camp again. There were 2 van setups right next to us. One was interested in our tent and both had nice dogs.

## Day 9
#### Tripometer:
- We went back through Going-to-the-Sun Road today. It was a little less foggy and way clearer.
- As we ended, we turned to go up to Many Glacier. We got to the entrance to the park but a Ranger told us that that part of the park was too congested and that they couldnt let us in.
- We got to camp, an RV park out of St. Mary's, and sat at the counter in the office for a bit of WiFi and charge. We have started laundry, taken showers, and are sitting outside the office watching various fireworks blast over the town.
