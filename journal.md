##### Photo link: [Google Photos]: https://photos.app.goo.gl/DJ6TizUsq8nhBZHC9

## Day 1
#### Tripometer: 738
- We left La Crescenta around 6:20 and arrived at our stop for the night at around 6:30, making around 12 hours of driving for the day. 
- We ate lunch at Cesar Chavez Park in Berkeley at a turnaround where one could see 3 major Bay Area bridges.
- The scene change was drastic as we went from the 5 to the 580 - from desert and nothingness to dense forest, and even denser forest and interesting landscapes as we went north on the 101.
- Tonight we are staying on a dirt roundabout hidden next to a logging road, about 15 minutes north of Trinidad. Found on **iOverlander**, we chose this after exploring two other options, one just being a small turnout on a one lane overgrown dirt road in the hills above the coast.
- We arent tired even after all the driving today. However, Andrew is having to deal with Lactaid responsibilities.
- No service here but I am collecting most media on an external drive.
- We stopped for gas in Fresno, Berkeley, and near Humbolt.

## Day 2
#### Tripometer: 1002
- Woke up this morning at 7:30, made coffee and bagels, and got on the road north, following the 101 all the way.
- We followed a scenic route on Yurok territory and found an amazing overlook on the last of the California Coast.
- Around 11:40, we stopped at Whaleshead beach. It was completely fogged in to about 50 foot visiblity and led to some interesting photos. We made lunch there and headed up north, stopping in Coos Bay. 
- We looked for Coos Bay stickers but couln't find any, so we bought local fudge. 
- In Coos Bay, we talked to the visitor information desk and learned that Oneata Gorge, our plan for tomorrow, was closed, and also learned how bad the 5 north into Portland would be. We decided to change day 3 to instead go to Eugene and back to the coast towards Cannon Beach. Plan to camp near Astoria.

- We settled tonight north of Florence in a camp called Horse Creek. It is in the clouds and everything, even the air, is wet. If you swipe your hand though the air it collects visible water. Cole and Andrew found orange berries, Salmon berries, and have obsessed over them. They are like bland raspberries.

- Roomate selection sucks. It opened today, I've made the obligatory facebook post. One guy's desciption was, "I have Porsche", and nothing else.
- Changing clothes for the first time tomorrow morning.

## Day 3
#### Tripometer: idk
- Tent was wet so we decided to let it dry a little in the morning sun. We looked at the traffic for the route to Eugene and decided against a roundtrip journey.
- We headed north on the 101 again and found some interesting things/observations
..- a large cutout (maybe 15 ft tall) of a Japanese man holding a plate of sushi outside a closed Japanese restaurant
..- A ton of drive thru coffee stands
..- The suggested posted speeds for turns are high estimates, unlike california's lowball
..- Cool tide pools along the coast

- We got to Cannon Beach and realized that the hype wasn't worth it. Drove to Ecola State Park and stopped at a cool overlook on Ecola Beach.

- We continued north, crossing the Astoria Bridge across the Columbia. Andrew yelled BRIDGE all the way across.
- We are now staying at Snag Lake in the mountains above Naselle, Washington. We got service here na dthe small lake is amazing. I am writing this while waiting to shoot the night sky.

- Another thing for today; we visited the Tillamook Creamery. It was like a lame amusement park.
- Tomorrow we will continue up to Cape Flattery and Neah Bay, meet Andrew's family, and stay near Port Angeles in an RV Park with them. The next day we have planned to go to the REI Flagship store in Seattle, ferry north, and explore Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest near the US Canada Border.
- Trying to wake up a little earlier tomorrow.

## Days 4-6
#### Tripometer: 2068.2 miles
- So after Florence, the PNW Itineray went out the window. After Snag Lake, we went up the Washington Coast and explored a little of Olympic National Park. Stopped at the Ranger Station and hiked less than a mile to a large tree.
- We also stopped at a fish hatchery on reservation land that was playing a 23 min video on the history of the reservation. We did not watch the whole video.
- Later, we arrived at Neah Bay and learned that we needed to buy a pass to park and hike to Cape Flattery. We did not do that. Instead, we just drove around and trued to find good photo ops. On the road out to Neah Bay one can see Canada.
- After that, we drove to Port Angeles. Cole and I argued about whether the name Guy can be pronounced "gee". I won.
- At the RV Park in Port Angeles, we met Andrew's family. We showered and did a load of laundry. We made smores and talked with Andrew's aunt, uncle, and cousin. At 11, we went out to the mouth of the sound and shot the sky.
- Dinner that night was interesting; Cole attempted chicken and white sauce. He cooked the chicken and started the white sauce. As he put the parmesean cheese in, it coagulated instead of melting in with the milk. We only at the chicken.
- I made coffee with 1/2 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp milk, rest water, and a dark french roast starbucks via. Bitter but very creamy.
- We woke up early the next day and headed for Kingston to board a ferry to Edmonds. We were trying to get into Seattle to Pike's Place. We drove in, parked, and started walking the couple blocks to Pike's Place. 
- However, we quickly learned that a Pride Parade was happenning on a street crossing our path. We eventually found a way through the parade and at lunch at the Pike's Place fish market. More specifically, Athenian Fish and Chips. The chef working infront of us had worked at Philmont in 2012. While at the market, we also bought a fresh salmon fillet for that night's dinner.
- We also walked the boardwalk and saw the 2 hour wait for the original Starbucks. We found our way back to the car eventually, fighting back through the parade. We drove to REI just to get stickers.
- Heading up the 5, we turned onto the 20 East. We planned to stay at a more primitive camp on Baker Lake. We found an amazing spot and were soon joined by a loud college group.
- We cooked the salmon somehow very well on the camp stove, as well as some mashed potatoes and fresh greenbeans.
- Here, we saw 2 snakes in camp.
- Day 6 we headed through the North Cascades, a look into what Glacier might be. We were a little disapointed but really only got the roadside attractions. We drove all the way through Spokane, listening to a Dollop espisode on Spokane's history of corrupt police. We ate dinner at a Panda Express in Idaho and headed for the hills for camp.
- Midway to Spokane was the town of Winthrop, where we had lunch. Andrew drank all the pickle juice in the jar just to get the last 2 pickles and felt very sick afterwards.
##### Days 4-6 are written in the past tense. I didnt do them until night 7

## Day 7
#### Tripometer: 2356.5 miles
- After a week on the road, we are getting a little tired. We restocked in Hayden, Idaho. At the supermarket, we pretty much emptied our cooler because we had not been completely successful in keeping everything cold. We spent 2 hours there but are back on track now. We bought a lot more fruit and planned the meals a bit better.
- We drove to just outside Glacier National Park, crossing into Montana. The first site we found seemed good. It was off a dirt road out of a staging area on Flathead Lake. There was a roudy group of teenagers at the end of the road, 50 meters away.
- We made dinner and started to chill until we heard that they had an AR and were seeming to have too much fun with it. We quickly packed up the tent and searched iOverlander for a new site. We found maybe the best spot on the trip. It is a rocky beach on the side of a river and we are with other overlanding folk. Super cool.
- We have to start being aware of bears now.
- Also, everytime we cross a bridge now, we all yell BRIDGE all the way across.
- Plan tomorrow is to enter Glacier National Park, use THE pass, and begin exploring.

## Day 8
#### Tripometer: 2522.7 miles
- Today we drove the Going-to-the-Sun Road through Glacier. It was really foggy but we stopped often for pictures. About half way up we were stopped in a line of cars. They were plowing snow and had nearly the entire road wait. We got through, trying to stop at Logan Pass but couldnt find parking. 
- After we got through the road, we took the 2 back which was a lot longer and kinda went through the middle of nowhere montana.
- We went back to the riverside for camp again. There were 2 van setups right next to us. One was interested in our tent and both had nice dogs.

## Day 9
#### Tripometer: 2614.5 miles
- We went back through Going-to-the-Sun Road today. It was a little less foggy and way clearer.
- As we ended, we turned to go up to Many Glacier. We got to the entrance to the park but a Ranger told us that that part of the park was too congested and that they couldnt let us in.
- We got to camp, an RV park out of St. Mary's, and sat at the counter in the office for a bit of WiFi and charge. We have started laundry, taken showers, and are sitting outside the office watching various fireworks blast over the town.

- As Im about to go to bed, we wired up a long male to female 12vdc cigarette cable into the tent off of the outlet in the car that is always on to charge out phones in the tent. Very sketchy.
- There are various firework shows going on with a main one just over a hill that we cant see. We spent a few hours finishing laundry and watched a family light ground fireworks on the side of the road.
- We plan on eating a nice breakfast at the diner on the grounds.

- Watching Pulp Fiction in the tent as it downloads on Netflix.

## Day 10
#### Tripometer: 2949.6 miles
- Today we started off by eating breakfast at Johnson's Cafe, the restaurant at the RV park. We had to wait a decent amount of time but it was worth the wait. We all got the loaded omelete. Cole signed us in wrong and one of the watiers thought we were foreign and didnt speak english.
- After breakfast, we headed towards Red Cliff campground just north of Yellowstone.
- We restocked on Helena at the quietest supermarket Ive ever seem. We also got more dry ice for the cooler.
- The drive through southern montana is super boring. Though, the speed limit was 80 almost all the way.
- We arrived at Red Cliff, setup, and took a walk around. We found some rock climbers up a short trail out of camp.
- We are trying to book white water rafting for tomorrow but Andrew is the only one with any service. We called Mr. Obryan to try to secure a reservation because andrew's service can really only call and text. Will see if it worked tomorrow.\

- We decided to instead schedule for sunday and make tomorrow an easy morning.

## Day 11
#### Tripometer: 3141.5 miles (PI!!!)
- We slept in today because we werent going to go white water rafting.
- We made it to West Yellowstone by around 11:30 but the traffic was so bad that we made it to the ever-so packed Old Faithful by around 3:10. We got there just in time to see it go at 3:37.
- Yellowstone is very cool, but the way in which it it commercialized is obscene. It was worse than Disneyland. We concluded that Death Valley is far superior and that this was the only time we needed to see the park.
- Although it was like a zoo of people, we did see some cool wildlife in the stop and go traffic. There were dozens of Bison, many geese in the various small lakes and rivers, and some Moose, one with a large rack.

- We ate dinner in West Yellowstone at a BBQ place (very good place called Beartooth) after spending many brutal hours in stop and go traffic trying to exit the park.
- Arrived at Rainbow Point and learned that we had booked a site with electric. We are charging up all devices in camp instead of in the car.
- Rafting tomorrow morning at 9:45, but the place is about an hour north, making it an early morning. No Pulp Fiction tonight.

- In these areas we actually hace to be thinking of bears. When we go to bed we have to put all food in the cooler or the car.

- Reception out here is spotty and really only in the city. However, there was a tower dedicated to the Old Faithful Visitor's Center.

## Day 12
#### Tripometer: 3286.9 miles
- We started today a little early, waking up at "7", really 7:15 after a few alarms. We made our way from Rainbow Point campground to Montana Whitewater, a few miles north of Big Sky.
- We got our gear and got on the bus to the dropoff point where we met our guide, Hatter.
- Got on the water and pretty soon the guide had noticed the Philmont brand on my hat. He had been to Philmont in '99 as a young adult as well.
- The other three on our raft were part of the Peace Corps and were working in Butte.
- The Gallatin river has some good class 3 rapids, but the so called class 4 was not nearly big enough. Most of the river was calm but with a strong enough current such that we didnt need to paddle most of the time.
- We got out of the river and back to the main office by lunch time and made more tailgate samdwiches in the parking lot.

- I wanted to check on UCR housing, so we drove south into West Yellowstone and found a coffee and ice cream shop that we though had WiFi. I asked for the password, but what was given didn't work. We finished our ice cream and checked out the photography shop on the main street. They rent out lenses good for wildlife, like the Tamron 150-600, right outside the park, a smart idea.
- We went back to Rainbow Point campground and sat on the lake, eating oranges, for an hour or so. We watched a truck back the boat into the lake, try to get it off the trailer, then pull the truck forward off the boat ramp with the boat still on and drive off.
- Cole tried to make the skirt steak for dinner with rice and onions. The meat was so tough it was almost inedible.

- Andrew tried to was his hair with a little soap and the shower bag which we filled when we got to camp. However, Cole had the CampSuds and was squeezing more and more soap into Andrew's hair when he looked down. It took him around 10 minutes to wash his hair and didn't know what happened.

- We felt the wind pickup and knew that meant rain. We quickly packed up, bear proofed camp, and got in the tent. It didnt rain and we are currently sitting in the tent, watching the campers next to us have a fire while Andrew writes his novel.

## Day 13
#### 3481.0 miles
- Started today late around 9 and packed up quick to get back through the park. Even with less traffic due to it being a monday, it took us a long time to get through to the southern entrance.
- Entered the Grand Teton area and stopped frequently to see the amazing spires.
- I quickly wanted to summit the peaks of and around the Grand Teton at 13,770 ft. I looked into it at one of the visitor's centers and found that it is a short trail of 2 miles but with a lot of mountaineering and 2700 ft of elevation gain just to the Grand Teton. I want to plan a long, multi day trip to summit a lot of the peaks and spires in the area.
- We ate lunch along Jackson Lake and made our way to Jackson Hole around 3.

- Jackson Hole has a full mountain bike park and what looks like to be an amazing ski area in the winter with a tram to a peak at somewhere around 10,000 ft.

- Made our way south of Jackson to cut a little time out of tomorrow.

- Camping in the backcountry of Wyoming where free range cattle live and hunting is big. Near the truck is a trailer with ATVs, but no truck. Must be a base camp for a hunter.
- On our way up to the site, we found cattle in the road. The didnt want to move at the sight of the truck, so we turned on the KCs and Cole rolled down his window and shouted at them. The finally moved.
- We setup, made dinner, and saw the cows coming up the hill. There were mayube 30-40 in the herd coming up. We quickly packed up dinner and got in the tent to watch the cows pass. They got pretty close and we could watch them walk in a herd up the road 20-30 feet away from the tent.

- Tomorrow we will drive down to Steamboat Spring, CO. This is were Big Agnes is headquartered and where we will restock.

## Day 14
#### Tripometer: 3839.6 miles
- Mainly travel day.

- We woke up late because we heard rain at 7:30. Watched the cows get run to trailers by guys on horseback.
- Figured that most of our dairy had started to go bad and threw most of it out.

- Southern Wyoming is incredibly boring.
 
- We got to Steamboat Springs and restocked. Got some more dry ice and an incredibe amount of fruit.
- Found a spot on iOverlander in the hills above. It is labled as an actual campground but is not managed. We got to the turnoff and found a rutted out dirt road.
- Chose a flat spot where one can barely hear the highway.
- Earlier, we had bought a bag of frozen pot stickers and were going to make then for this night. Thankfully, we bought another bag today because the origianl bag had turned into one massive, disgusting pot sticker.

- We had a fire. Most of the wood around was decomposing and was very dry. 
- Got in the tent and started watching Narcos on netflix. Got through S1E1 and half of E2.

- Elevation for the night: 9208 ft. There was snow in various places around us.

- I finally got a dorm room, D207 in Enginuity, but roommate situation is still up in the air.

## Day 15
#### Tripometer: 4089.8 miles
- I woke up around 6:45 and watched the alpine sunrise. There was some ice around and I could see my breath for a few minutes.

- We were on the road by 8:30 towards Rocky Mountains National Park.

- RMNP is amazing. The landscape is incredible as snow still covers a lot of the mountains. Most of RMNP is seen by backpacking in. The road through the park still sees a lot. It even gets to somewhere in the range of 12,000 ft.
- We got through and headed towards Boulder.

- As Cole and I have been talking to Andrew about college, we stopped at CU Boulder and walked around.
- We decided to not stay in Boulder, our planned spot, but to drive down to Colorado Springs and stay in the hills. This would reduce tomorrows drive to Garden of the Gods and Pike's Peak.

- We made breakfast for dinner, just chorizo, carton eggs, and OBrien style potatos. We have enough for another of this dinner.

- Around this spot are some amazing trees to climb, with branches just far enough apart to challenge vertically and some close enough together to challenge one's planned route.

- Tomorrow, we will wake early to go into Colorado Springs for breakfast and so Cole can finish housing. We will then explore Garden of the Gods and drive up Pike's Peak.

## Day 16
#### Tripometer: 4180.3
- Woke up this morning and found a local diner to eat at. Cole had to do housing stuff and needed a place to sit and do it. Eating at an actual place with large plates and american style breakfast was nice too.
- Drove through Garden of the Gods. I went in thinking it would be a cool spot to scramble with not a huge crowd. I was completely wrong. The crowd caused stop and go traffic in the park and scrambling is illegal without a climbing permit and proper gear. Disgusting and disapointing.

- Hoped for more as we drove to Pikes Peak. We were open to the cost of 15 per person due to the road's fame. It was incredibly steep and windy, a lot of fun. However, there is construction at the top and they werent allowing cars all the way to the top. We had to park at mile 16 and take a shuttle to the peak. The crowd there also made it almost not worth it.
- On the way down the road, there was a brake inspection check point. Just interesting to see that this is necessary.
- Each car is supposed to ride 1st all the way down due to the steepness and length. If I didn't, the brakes would have gotten red hot and died.

- At the base of Pike's Peak, we booked a spot for the night at Rocky Top RV Park. It had been 7 days since laundry, shower, and trash disposal, so the amenities here were the draw. The camp also has decent WiFi throughout.
- We were able to charge all devices at the rec room and I was able to finish housing for good and find a roommate.

- Dinner was chicken stir fry which actually turned out pretty well.
